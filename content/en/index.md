Andrey Vinogradov plays modern hurdy-gurdy (Viola) crafted by <a href="http://www.weichselbaumer.cc">Wolfgang Weichselbaumer</a>, Vienna. With this perfect instrument he presents a peculiar mix of ethnic tunes (Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian,Greek, Austrian, etc.), contemporary classical music, jazz improvisations and authentic Russian sacred chants. Andreyâ€™s virtuoso playing technique and elaborate multidimensional compositions create a unique musical atmosphere.
